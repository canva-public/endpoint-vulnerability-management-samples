# Endpoint Vulnerability Management Samples

This file is a companion to Canva's blog post on how we do endpoint vulnerability management at scale. In order to avoid overloading readers with some of the technical details, we've split the writeup. This way we allow the more technical readers to also dive deep and learn how they can implement a similar solution for their organisation.

The queries shown here support the `How we measure success` section of the blog and will follow the same pattern of headings.

> :warning: **Please be aware that the data used below is not real. The data we used is for illustrative purposes only and it may showcase issues with the vulnerability management program. This is intentional and is explicitly done to demonstrate what some of the issues can look like. The data does not reflect the actual data or status of the vulnerability management process at Canva.**

The sample data used in the graphs published on the blog is available in the [sample_data](/sample_data) folder.

## How we measure success

After ingesting the data into Snowflake, we can use the following query to see some basic information.

```sql
SELECT
	application,
	applicationname,
	applicationvendor,
	applicationversion,
	cveid,
	detectiondate,
	endpoint_data_id,
	id,
	lastscandate,
	lastscanresult,
	nvdbasescore,
	nvdcvssversion,
	ostype,
	publisheddate,
	ingestion_date
FROM
	vulnerability
```

The integration that reads the data from S3 and ingests it into Snowflake adds the `ingestion_date` field, which allows us to see a snapshot of vulnerability data at any previous point in time as well as review trends over time.

### Vulnerabilities over time

This view shows us whether our methods to reduce vulnerabilities work.

> :warning: **Note that the query here, as well as a few of the queries below, utilize a statement to limit the data returned by the queries to the last 90 days. If you're experimenting with the sample data, you may need to adjust this value accordingly.**

> :warning: **Please be aware that the average used here is relative to the previous rows returned by the query. That means that it can be skewed by days where no data is returned. This issue can be addressed, but it requires using a [CTE](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/queries-cte) that contains all the dates and then performing a `JOIN` operations against the data returned. Due to the added complexity, this work is considered out of scope for this document.**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ingestion_date) AS "Date",
    -- Sets the severity of the vulnerability based on the score.
    CASE
        WHEN nvdbasescore < 4 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN nvdbasescore < 7 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN nvdbasescore < 9 THEN 'High'
        WHEN nvdbasescore <= 10 THEN 'Critical'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS "CVSS Severity",
    -- Each vulnerability ID is a different record, we want to count those.
    COUNT(DISTINCT id) as "Vulnerability Count",
    -- This average is useful to see the general trend for the data.
    AVG("Vulnerability Count") OVER (
        PARTITION BY "CVSS Severity" ORDER BY "Date" ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS "3 day average"
FROM
    vulnerability
WHERE
    -- Only show data for the past 90 days.
    DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ingestion_date) > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY "Date", "CVSS Severity"
ORDER BY "Date"
```

### Top widespread vulnerable applications

With this view, it’s easy to visualize if a set of applications, in particular, introduces the most risk to the organization. It can help prioritize efforts into which applications to manage.

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
	-- We're not using vendor in the graph, but would be just as easy to see vendor data if we were interested in it.
	applicationvendor,
	applicationname,
	-- This will give us the number of endpoints where the vulnerable application is deployed.
	COUNT(DISTINCT endpoint_data_id) as "Vulnerable Endpoints"
FROM
	vulnerability
WHERE
	-- For this query, we're only interested in the data from the latest report.
	ingestion_date = (SELECT MAX(ingestion_date) FROM vulnerability)
GROUP BY
	applicationvendor,
	applicationname
ORDER BY
	"Vulnerable Endpoints"
DESC
```

### Vulnerability age through time

This view provides interesting data about the vulnerability age in the environment. The graph tends to climb steadily because each day vulnerabilities become a day older, but it can give you some insights into how old the unaddressed vulnerabilities are.

```sql
SELECT
	-- Calculate percentiles using days since the vulnerability was detected.
	PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY daysdetected) AS p50,
	PERCENTILE_DISC(0.95) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY daysdetected) AS p95,
	MAX(daysdetected::INTEGER) AS "Max",
	DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ingestion_date) AS "Date"
FROM
	vulnerability
WHERE
	-- Only show data for the past 90 days.
	DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ingestion_date) > DATE_TRUNC('DAY', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')
GROUP BY
	-- Group by date so we can see how the numbers change daily and look at trends over time.
	"Date"
ORDER BY
	"Date"
```

### Widespread managed vulnerable applications out of SLA

The view produced by the following query is what we've found most impactful at Canva. It’s more complex than previous views, using an external table to determine which applications we centrally manage. Since non-managed applications are excluded from results, it should, in theory, return no data. Realistically, however, we should expect to see spikes from vulnerabilities being published and then quickly resolved throughout the fleet automatically. Any sustained numbers indicate issues with the vulnerability management process.

```sql
WITH vulnerabilities_out_of_sla_managed_apps AS (
    SELECT
        applicationname,
        applicationvendor,
        applicationversion,
        daysdetected,
        nvdbasescore,
        endpoint_data_id,
        ingestion_date
    FROM
        vulnerability
    JOIN
        /* We are joining the vulnerability data with a table that contains managed data, this
        /* allows us to discard vulnerable applications that are not centrally managed. */
        managed_applications
    ON
        LOWER(applicationname) = LOWER(managed_applications.application_name)
        AND
        (
            LOWER(applicationvendor) = LOWER(application_vendor)
            OR managed_applications.application_vendor IS NULL
        )
        AND LOWER(ostype) = LOWER(managed_applications.application_os)
    WHERE
        -- Only get data for the past 90 days.
        DATE_TRUNC('DAY', ingestion_date) > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
        -- The logic below checks whether a vulnerability is breaching SLA.
        AND
        (
            (

            )

            )
            OR
            (
                -- For high vulnerabilities, the SLA is 2 days.
                (

                    /* vulnerabilities with unknown CVSS scores as high. */
                    OR nvdbasescore IS NULL
                )
                AND daysdetected >= 2
            )
